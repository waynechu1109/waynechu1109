# Hi There! 👋

I’m **Wayne Chu** — a Stanford MSEE student who is passionate about developing applications in robotics and computer vision.

<!-- ## 🚀 What I Do  
I build **vision‑based AI systems** to tackle real‑world problems—most recently, a **Smart Fridge** prototype that recognizes food using camera input and suggests recipes to minimize waste.

I’ve also worked on **robot autonomy**, **Turtlebot navigation**, and generative prompt pipelines using the **Google Gemini API**. -->

<!-- ## 🌱 What’s Next  
- Deepening my work in **large vision models** and **prompt engineering** for real‑world applications  
- Preparing for my graduate studies at **Stanford University**, focusing on robotics and computer vision  
- Experimenting with embedded systems and robotics platforms to bridge AI theory and hands‑on impact

## 🤝 Let’s Collaborate  
Interested in:  
- Vision systems that think and act  
- AI‑powered sustainability projects (food, environment, robotics)  
- Open‑source tools for real‑time camera processing and prompt‑based models  

If these vibe with you, let’s build something together! -->

## 🧠 A Bit About Me  
I believe tech should be **playful**, **open**, and maybe a bit unexpected. When I’m not coding, I’m probably taking photos of airplanes.
